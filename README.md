README.md — QIMES v2.0 (Quantum-Inspired Multi-Axis Ethical State Model)
Overview
QIMES v2.0 is a theoretical ethical decision-model designed to explore how future AI systems might evaluate complex moral situations in a probabilistic, context-sensitive, and dignity-preserving way.
The framework integrates concepts from:
quantum cognition
multi-axis decision modeling
human rights–based normative constraints
QIMES v2.0 is not intended as a fully validated or production-ready system.
It is a conceptual model, created to propose a structured and testable approach to ethical reasoning in AI.
Motivation
Current AI systems often rely on pattern recognition and statistical optimization, which can be inadequate for handling deep or ambiguous ethical dilemmas.
QIMES proposes an alternative theoretical direction:
Moral states are represented as superpositions of multiple ethical tendencies, influenced by context and constrained by human dignity.
This allows the model to express uncertainty, conflicting principles, and contextual dependencies in a formal manner.
QIMES is aimed at illustrating how a more principled ethical layer in future AI could be structured—especially in scenarios where classical linear decision models fail.
Core Components of QIMES v2.0
1. Three-Axis State Representation
Ethical states are represented as vectors in a Hilbert-space-like structure with three orthogonal axes:
Harm Axis – Non-maleficence and avoidance of active harm
Benefit Axis – Welfare, well-being, and consequentialist evaluation
Reflection Axis – Meta-cognition, coherence, duty, and virtue-based aspects
The amplitude along each axis encodes the probability distribution over competing ethical tendencies.
2. Contextual Collapse
Inspired by quantum cognition (not by physics), QIMES models decision-making as:
superposition of moral impulses
interference effects caused by framing, context, and information order
collapse into a specific decision when a concrete evaluation is required
This is a conceptual analogy, not a physical process.
3. Dignity Constraints
A defining feature of QIMES v2.0 is its integration of non-negotiable human dignity constraints, derived from universal human rights principles.
These constraints function as a hard veto, blocking any decision that violates fundamental human dignity—even if utilitarian calculations would justify it.
This normative boundary differentiates QIMES from purely consequentialist or purely rule-based frameworks.
4. Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)
QIMES explicitly acknowledges that certain ethical dilemmas cannot be resolved algorithmically.
In ambiguous or norm-conflicting cases, the model defaults to:
human review or expert intervention.
This emphasizes that the framework is not meant to fully replace human moral judgment.
QIMES v2.0 Benchmark
This repository includes a theoretical benchmark consisting of 100 crafted ethical scenarios, covering:
medical ethics
privacy and surveillance
fairness and discrimination
autonomy and manipulation
resource allocation
free speech vs. harm
Each scenario includes:
harm and benefit values
contextual factors
potential dignity violations
a ground-truth theoretical evaluation
(approve / block / human_review)
The benchmark is designed to compare different hypothetical models
(e.g., utilitarian, rule-based, statistical, QIMES-like approaches).
Again, this benchmark is theoretical, focusing on conceptual evaluation rather than empirical validation.
Purpose
QIMES v2.0 is intended to:
propose a structured way to think about ethical decision processes in AI
demonstrate how moral uncertainty and contextuality can be formalized
explore how dignity-preserving constraints could function in future systems
offer a testable conceptual model for researchers and enthusiasts
It does not claim to be a complete or experimentally verified ethical system.
Instead, it aims to contribute to ongoing discussions on alignment, AGI safety, and ethical AI architecture.
Status
QIMES v2.0 is a theoretical model developed independently, without institutional affiliation.
It is shared openly for exploration, critique, refinement, and inspiration.
Contributions, discussions, and alternative interpretations are welcome.
